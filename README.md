# FrontendTest

## Getting Started

To install the project, please, download it or clone, and then after downloading use

```sh
npm i
```


And open "client" folder and use:

```sh
npm i
```

Then run project with:

```sh
npm run dev
```
When server source files change, the badge server should automatically restart itself (using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)). When the frontend files change, the frontend dev server should also automatically reload. 

## Usage

In header menu there are four buttons which switch pages with tasks

Pages show performing tasks with default test data:
Task 1 has test data which saved in carsData.json
Task 2 has test data which saved in client/src/task2Data.json
Task 3 has test data which saved in client/src/task3Data.json
Task 4 has test data which saved in client/src/task4Data.json
